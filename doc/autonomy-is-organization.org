* Notes

autonomous, resilient, growth

support people to organize themselves
without the need of a larger organisation among them
empowering potential creatives to feel involved
and constantly productive, organising themselves

the examples are anarchists in hostile situations
where being autonomous and efficient for a single cell
is vital

or players into the economy games, to create companies
rather than work for large multi-nationals
where the attractive element is that of a large organisation
that organises your life for you
one of the reasons most people end up working there
(tanti amici...)
