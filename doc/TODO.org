** TODO Build system

*** DONE Make pub/ the destination directory for generated contents
    CLOSED: [2010-06-16 Wed 18:27]
*** DONE Automatically take .org files from org/ if it exists.
    CLOSED: [2010-06-16 Wed 18:27]
*** DONE Remove dependency on external scripts
    CLOSED: [2010-06-16 Wed 18:27]
*** TODO Have autogen.sh check for dependencies

Should be done for distribution with Debian.

*** TODO Handle the --with-org-mode=auto

When --with-org-mode is passed to configure, 'auto' is given as the
load-path.  It should check for the presence of org-mode and use that,
or ask the user, or fallback to git submodule the org-mode source repo.

*** TODO Ensure portability on mobile devices

AutOrg should run everywhere Emacs does.
 
** TODO Make push/pull to website

A makefile and/or script that takes care of push/pull on remotely
published git

** TODO Org-Protocol

Make a set of procedures and/or autmatizations (scripts?
instructions?) to setup various external applications to interact with
autorg via org-protocolo-open-source 

*** DONE Correct makefile for pub
    CLOSED: [2010-06-16 Wed 18:26]

Published pages should be recompiled only when the .org file is
changed, not every time we do a make command. Correct this behaviour
by writing a good Make.

Solution: use org-publish and take advantage of the org-mode cache.

** TODO Awk server

Make a test with awk http server

eventually integrate org-protocol into awk urls
