* AutOrg
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: AutOrg
:END:

** Make push/pull to website

A makefile and/or script that takes care of push/pull on remotely
published git

** Org-Protocol

Make a set of procedures and/or autmatizations (scripts?
instructions?) to setup various external applications to interact with
autorg via org-protocolo-open-source 

** Correct makefile for pub

Published pages should be recompiled only when the .org file is
changed, not every time we do a make command. Correct this behaviour
by writing a good Make.

** Awk server
Make a test with awk http server

eventually integrate org-protocol into awk urls
