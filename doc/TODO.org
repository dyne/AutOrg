We don't have anywhere to dump infortmation, do we?  So here it is.  I
recommend you read Francis Heyligen's take on GTD:
http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/GTD-cognition.pdf

It hints on scientific grounds for GTD, and provides directions for
using GTD in a group (although that part is tenuous and AutOrg should
be more attached to that part.)

** TODO Build system
*** DONE Make pub/ the destination directory for generated contents
    CLOSED: [2010-06-16 Wed 18:27]
*** DONE Automatically take .org files from org/ if it exists.
    CLOSED: [2010-06-16 Wed 18:27]
*** DONE Remove dependency on external scripts
    CLOSED: [2010-06-16 Wed 18:27]
*** TODO Have autogen.sh check for dependencies

Should be done for distribution with Debian.

*** TODO Handle the --with-org-mode=auto                             :v0.2.0:

When --with-org-mode is passed to configure, 'auto' is given as the
load-path.  It should check for the presence of org-mode and use that,
or ask the user, or fallback to git submodule the org-mode source repo.

*** TODO Ensure portability on mobile devices

AutOrg should run everywhere Emacs does.
 
** TODO Make push/pull to website
*** TODO Automate remote publication

(was:) A makefile and/or script that takes care of push/pull on remotely
published git

AutOrg doesn't really take care of the contents in org/, so it
shouldn't be responsible for updating the web files.  But it can take
care of two things:

 - Provide a script to use as a git hook or crontab for launching
   'make new-pages'
 - Make it easy to integrate with a org/ directory as a git repo

** TODO Org-Protocol

Make a set of procedures and/or autmatizations (scripts?
instructions?) to setup various external applications to interact with
autorg via org-protocolo-open-source 

*** DONE Correct makefile for pub
    CLOSED: [2010-06-16 Wed 18:26]

Published pages should be recompiled only when the .org file is
changed, not every time we do a make command. Correct this behaviour
by writing a good Make.

Solution: use org-publish and take advantage of the org-mode cache.

** TODO Awk server
*** TODO [#A] Fix display issue

 - the first page displayed is always the default page: it should be
   the page the user asked for
 - after some calls, the page doesn't display anymore, although it was
   served normally before

Those issues seem to relate to how awk opens and closes pipes and
co-processes.  The current script should probably extract the handling
of 404 errors so that it doesn't interfere with normal requests.

*** TODO [#B] Integrate org-protocol into awk urls

Make [[file:../src/server.awk.in][server.awk]] respond to [[file:org-protocol.org][org-protocol]] links to open the source file
in Emacs (and other applications.)

*** DONE Make a test with awk http server
    CLOSED: [2010-06-17 Thu 10:49]

** TODO How to Publish with AutOrg

Write a document that introduces the basics of org-mode, so that the
reader without prior knowledge can start producing hyperlinked
documents and share them with others.

Test and define strategies for "growing" an org/ directory locally or
with a team (e.g. using a remote git repository.)

Document usage with multiple projects (i.e. using different
sub-directories in org/)

* Releases
:PROPERTIES:
:CATEGORY: AutOrg
:END:
** v0.3.0 - 
*** TODO Name release
*** TODO Select features 
** TODO v0.2.0 - "locAlhOst: WYSNB"

localhost: where your social network belongs.

*** DONE Fix server.awk
    CLOSED: [2010-06-22 Tue 08:50]

Maybe remove 404 support for now.

*** TODO --with-org-mode=auto

Handle the case:
 1. check standard emacs paths for org-mode
 2. fallback to git submodule src/org-mode checked out at the most
    recent tag (in future version: a stable tag)

** DONE v0.1.0 - "Squatting Action"
   CLOSED: [2010-06-22 Tue 08:45]

Eviction Round vs. Squatting Action, Amsterdam, 2010:
 - 8 squats closed
 - 4 squats opened
 - Net result: One single mother with 2 young children in the street.
   250K EUR per squat of public money spent on police.

*** DONE Remove make test / server support

We'll fix it and add it in 0.2.0

*** DONE Cleanup documentation
