#+TITLE:   Semantic Versioning

SemVer was proposed by Tom Preston-Werner as a way to provide a
rational software versioning to help automated integration of third
party software.

Software following Semantic Versioning use 3 numbers (separated by a
dot): the Major, Minor and Patch version.

A new Major version is released when introducing backward-incompatible
features.  A new Minor version is released when new features are
introduced in the public API, that are backwards-compatible.  A Patch
version is release whenever a backwards-compatible bug fixes are
implemented.

Once a release is made, it won't change: any changes to the source
code must be distributed in the next release.
Starting with release 0.2.0, AutOrg follows [[http://semver.org][SemVer]].
