Munch will take a word list and output an affix compressed version of
the list to stdout.  Is syntax is 

munch <word list file> <affix file>

The input word list for munch MUST start with a number indicating the
number of words in the list.  A good way to find it is 'wc -l'.

To use the list to create an Aspell dictionary you need to remove the
first line in the output which is the number of words in the output
list.

I hope to eventually integrate this program with the rest of Aspell.
