   As far as coding styles go I am really not that picky.  The important
thing is to stay consistent.  However, please whatever you do, do not
indent with more than 4 characters as I find indenting with more than
that extremely difficult to read as most of the code ends up on the
right side of the screen.

2 How to Submit a Patch
***********************

Bug reports and patches should be submitted via the Sourceforge Tracker
at `http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=245' rather than being
posted to any of the mailing lists.

   The mailing lists are good if you need to check something out or need
help or feedback from other readers, but they are not the best place to
submit bugs or patches because they will likely get forgotten or lost
within the mailing list traffic if not acted upon immediately.

   Please make the effort to use the tracker.

3 C++ Standard Library
**********************

The C++ Standard library is not used directly except under very
specific circumstances.  The string class and the STL are used
indirectly through wrapper classes and all I/O is done using the
standard C library with light right helper classes to make using C I/O
a bit more C++ like.

   However the `new', `new[]', `delete' and `delete[]' operators are
used to allocate memory when appropriate.

4 Templates
***********

Templates are used in Aspell when there is a clear advantage to doing
so.  Whenever you use templates please use them carefully and try very
hard not to create code bloat by generating a lot of unnecessary and
duplicate code.


File: aspell-dev.info,  Node: Error Handling,  Next: Source Code Layout,  Prev: Templates,  Up: Top

5 Error Handling
****************

Exceptions are not used in Aspell as I find them more trouble than they
are worth.  Instead an alternate method of error handling is used which
is based around the PosibErr class.  PosibErr is a special Error
handling device that will make sure that an error is properly handled.
It is defined in `posib_err.hpp'.  PosibErr is expected to be used as
the return type of the function. It will automatically be converted to
the "normal" return type however if the normal returned type is
accessed and there is an "unhandled" error condition it will abort. It
will also abort if the object is destroyed with an "unhandled" error
condition.  This includes ignoring the return type of a function
returning an error condition.  An error condition is handled by simply
checking for the presence of an error, calling ignore, or taking
ownership of the error.

   The PosibErr class is used extensively throughout Aspell.  Please
refer to the Aspell source for examples of using PosibErr until better
documentation is written.

7 Strings
*********

7.1 String
==========

The `String' class provided the same functionality of the C++ string
except for fewer constructors.  It also inherits `OStream' so that you
can write to it with the `<<' operator.  It is defined in `string.hpp'.

7.2 ParmString
==============

ParmString is a special string class that is designed to be used as a
parameter for a function that is expecting a string.  It is defined in
`parm_string.hpp'.  It will allow either a `const char *' or `String'
class to be passed in.  It will automatically convert to a `const char
*'.  The string can also be accessed via the `str' method.  Usage
example:

void foo(ParmString s1, ParmString s2) {
   const char * str0 = s1;
   unsigned int size0 = s2.size()
   if (s1 == s2 || s2 == "bar") {
     ...
   }
}
...
String s1 = "...";
foo(s1);
const char * s2 = "...";
foo(s2);

   This class should be used when a string is being passed in as a
parameter.  It is faster than using `const String &' (as that will
create an unnecessary temporary when a `const char *' is passed in),
and is less annoying than using `const char *' (as it doesn't require
the `c_str()' method to be used when a `String' is passed in).

7.3 CharVector
==============

A character vector is basically a `Vector<char>' but it has a few
additional methods for dealing with strings which `Vector' does not
provide.  It, like `String', is also inherits `OStream' so that you can
write to it with the `<<' operator.  It is defined in
`char_vector.hpp'.  Use it when ever you need a string which is
guaranteed to be in a continuous block of memory which you can write to.


File: aspell-dev.info,  Node: Smart Pointers,  Next: I/O,  Prev: Strings,  Up: Top

8 Smart Pointers
****************

Smart pointers are used extensively in Aspell to simplify memory
management tasks and to avoid memory leaks.

8.1 CopyPtr
===========

The `CopyPtr' class makes a deep copy of an object whenever it is
copied.  The `CopyPtr' class is defined in `copy_ptr.hpp'.  This header
should be included wherever `CopyPtr' is used.  The complete definition
of the object `CopyPtr' is pointing to does not need to be defined at
this point.  The implementation is defined in `copy_ptr-t.hpp'.  The
implementation header file should be included at a point in your code
where the class `CopyPtr' is pointing to is completely defined.

8.2 ClonePtr
============

`ClonePtr' is like copy pointer except the `clone()' method is used
instead of the copy constructor to make copies of an object.  If is
defined in `clone_ptr.hpp' and implemented in `clone_ptr-t.hpp'.

8.3 StackPtr
============

A `StackPtr' is designed to be used whenever the only pointer to a new
object allocated with `new' is on the stack.  It is similar to the
standard C++ `auto_ptr' but the semantics are a bit different.  It is
defined in `stack_ptr.hpp' -- unlike `CopyPtr' or `ClonePtr' it is
defined and implemented in this header file.

8.4 GenericCopyPtr
==================

A generalized version of `CopyPtr' and `ClonePtr' which the two are
based on.  It is defined in `generic_copy_ptr.hpp' and implemented in
`generic_copy_ptr-t.hpp'.


File: aspell-dev.info,  Node: I/O,  Next: Config Class,  Prev: Smart Pointers,  Up: Top

9 I/O
*****

Aspell does not use C++ I/O classes and functions in any way since they
do not provide a way to get at the underlying file number and can often
be slower than the highly tuned C I/O functions found in the standard C
library.  However, some lightweight wrapper classes are provided so
that standard C I/O can be used in a more C++ like way.

9.1 IStream/OStream
===================

These two base classes mimic some of the functionally of the C++
functionally of the corresponding classes.  They are defined in
`istream.hpp' and `ostream.hpp' respectively.  They are however based
on standard C I/O and are not proper C++ streams.

9.2 FStream
===========

Defined in `fstream.hpp'.

9.3 Standard Streams
====================

`CIN'/`COUT'/`CERR'.  Defined in `iostream.hpp'.


File: aspell-dev.info,  Node: Config Class,  Next: Filter Interface,  Prev: I/O,  Up: Top

10 Config Class
***************

The `Config' class is used to hold configuration information.  It has a
set of keys which it will accept.  Inserting or even trying to look at
a key that it does not know will produce an error.  It is defined in
`common/config.hpp'.


File: aspell-dev.info,  Node: Filter Interface,  Next: Filter Modes,  Prev: Config Class,  Up: Top

11 Filter Interface
*******************

11.1 Overview
=============

In Aspell there are 5 types of filters:
  1. _Decoders_ which take input in some standard format such as
     iso8859-1 or UTF-8 and convert it into a string of `FilterChars'.

  2. _Decoding filters_ which manipulate a string of `FilterChars' by
     decoding the text is some way such as converting an SGML character
     into its Unicode value.

  3. _True filters_ which manipulate a string of `FilterChars' to make
     it more suitable for spell checking.  These filters generally
     blank out text which should not be spell checked

  4. _Encoding filters_ which manipulate a string of `FilterChars' by
     encoding the text in some way such as converting certain Unicode
     characters to SGML characters.

  5. _Encoders_ which take a string of `FilterChars' and convert into a
     standard format such as iso8859-1 or UTF-8

   Which types of filters are used depends on the situation
  1. When _decoding words_ for spell checking:
        * The _decoder_ to convert from a standard format

        * The _decoding filter_ to perform high level decoding if
          necessary

        * The _encoder_ to convert into an internal format used by the
          speller module

  2. When _checking a document_
        * The _decoder_ to convert from a standard format

        * The _decoding filter_ to perform high level decoding if
          necessary

        * A _true filter_ to filter out parts of the document which
          should not be spell checked

        * The _encoder_ to convert into an internal format used by the
          speller module

  3. When _encoding words_ such as those returned for suggestions:
        * The _decoder_ to convert from the internal format used by the
          speller module

        * The _encoding filter_ to perform high level encodings if
          necessary

        * The _encoder_ to convert into a standard format

   A `FilterChar' is a struct defined in `common/filter_char.hpp' which
contains two members, a character, and a width.  Its purpose is to keep
track of the width of the character in the original format.  This is
important because when a misspelled word is found the exact location of
the word needs to be returned to the application so that it can
highlight it for the user.  For example if the filters translated this:

Mr. foo said &quot;I hate my namme&quot;.

   to this

Mr. foo said "I hate my namme".

   without keeping track of the original width of the characters the
application  will likely highlight `e my '  as the misspelling because
the spell checker will return 25 as the offset  instead of 30.
However with keeping track of the width using `FilterChar' the  spell
checker  will know that the real position is 30 since the quote is
really 6 characters  wide.   In particular the text will be annotated
something like the following:

1111111111111611111111111111161
Mr. foo said "I hate my namme".

   The standard _encoder_ and _decoder_ filters are defined in
`common/convert.cpp'.  There should generally not be any need to deal
with them so they will not be discussed here.  The other three filters,
the _encoding filter_, the _true filter_, and the _decoding filter_,
are all defined the exact same way; they are inherited from the
`IndividualFilter' class.

11.2 Adding a New Filter
========================

A new filter basically is added by placing the corresponding loadable
object inside a directory reachable by Aspell via `filter-path' list.
Further it is necessary that the corresponding filter description file
is located in one of the directories listed by the `option-path' list.

   The name of the loadable object has to conform to the following
convention `libfiltername-filter.so' where `filtername' stands for the
name of the filter which is passed to Aspell by the `add-filter'
option.  The same applies to the filter description file which has to
conform to the following naming scheme: `filtername-filter.opt'.

   To add a new loadable filter object create a new file.

   Basically the file should be a C++ file and end in `.cpp'.  The file
should contain a new filter class inherited from `IndividualFilter' and
a constructor function called `new_filtertype' (see *Note Constructor
Function::) returning a new filter object.  Further it is necessary to
manually generate the filter description file.  Finally the resulting
object has to be turned into a loadable filter object using libtool.

   Alternatively a new filter may extend the functionality of an
existing filter. In this case the new filter has to be derived form the
corresponding valid filter class instead of the `IndividualFilter'
class.

11.3 IndividualFilter class
===========================

All filters are required to inherit from the `IndividualFilter' class
found in `indiv_filter.hpp'.  See that file for more details and the
other filter modules for examples of how it is used.

11.4 Constructor Function
=========================

After the class is created a function must be created which will return
a new filter allocated with `new'.  The function must have the
following prototype:
     C_EXPORT IndividualFilter * new_aspell_FILTERNAME_FILTERTYPE

   Filters are defined in groups where each group contains an _encoding
filter_, a _true filter_, and a _decoding filter_ (see *Note Filter
Overview::).  Only one of them is required to be defined, however they
all need a separate constructor function.

11.5 Filter Description File
============================

This file contains the description of a filter which is loaded by
Aspell immediately when the `add-filter' option is invoked.  If this
file is missing Aspell will complain about it.  It consists of lines
containing comments which must be started by a `#' character and lines
containing key value pairs describing the filter.  Each file at least
has to contain the following two lines in the given order.

     ASPELL >=0.60
     DESCRIPTION this is short filter description

   The first non blank, non comment line has to contain the keyword
`ASPELL' followed by the version of Aspell which the filter is usable
with.  To denote multiple Aspell versions the version number may be
prefixed by ``<'', ``<='', ``='', ``>='' or ``>'.  If the range prefix
is omitted ``='' is assumed.  The `DESCRIPTION' of the filter should be
under 50, begin in lower case, and note include any trailing
punctuation characters.  The keyword `DESCRIPTION' may be abbreviated
by `DESC'.

   For each filter feature (see *Note Filter Overview::) provided by the
corresponding loadable object, the option file has to contain the
following line:
     STATIC `filtertype'
   `filtertype' stands for one of `decoder', `filter' or `encoder'
denoting the entire filter type.  This line allows to statically (see
*Note Link Filters Static::) link the filter into Aspell if requested
by the user or by the system Aspell is built for.

     OPTION newoption
     DESCRIPTION this is a short description of newoption
     TYPE bool
     DEFAULT false
     ENDOPTION

   An option is added by a line containing the keyword `OPTION'
followed by the name of the option.  If this name is not prefixed by
the name of the filter Aspell will implicitly do that.  For the
`DESCRIPTION' of a filter option the same holds as for the filter
description.  The `TYPE' of the option may be one of `bool', `int',
`string' or `list'.  If the `TYPE' is omitted `bool' is assumed.  The
default value(s) for an option is specified via `DEFAULT' (short `DEF')
followed by the desired `TYPE' dependent default value.  The table
*Note Filter Default Values:: shows the possible values for each `TYPE'.

Type     Default   Available
bool     true      true false
int      0         any number value
string             any printable string
list               any comma separated list of strings

   Table 1. Shows the default values Aspell assumes if option
`description' lacks a `DEFAULT' or `DEF' line.

   The `ENDOPTION' line may be omitted as it is assumed implicitly if a
line containing `OPTION', `STATIC'.

     *Note* The keywords in a filter description file are case
     insensitive.  The above examples use the all uppercase for better
     distinguishing them from values and comments.  Further a filter
     description may contain blank lines to enhance their readability.

     *Note* An option of `list' type may contain multiple consecutive
     lines for default values starting with `DEFAULT' or `DEF', to
     specify numerous default values.

11.6 Retrieve Options by a Filter
=================================

An option always has to be retrieved by a filter using its full
qualified name as the following example shows.

     config->retrieve_bool("filter-filtername-newoption");

   The prefix `filter-' allows user to relate option uniquely to the
specific filter when `filtername-newoption' ambiguous an existing
option of Aspell.  The `filtername' stands for the name of the filter
the option belongs to and `-newoption' is the name of the option as
specified in the corresponding `.opt' file (see *Note Filter
Description File::

11.7 Compiling and Linking
==========================

See a good book on Unix programming on how to turn the filter source
into a loadable object.

11.8 Programmer's Interface
===========================

A more convenient way recommended, if filter is added to Aspell
standard distribution to build a new filter is provided by Aspell's
programmers interface for filter.  It is provided by the
`loadable-filter-API.hpp' file.  Including this file gives access to a
collection of macros hiding nasty details about runtime construction of
a filter and about filter debugging.  Table *Note Interface Macros::
shows the macros provided by the interface.  For details upon the
entire macros see `loadable-filter-API.hpp'.  An example on how to use
these macros can be found at `examples/loadable/ccpp-context.hpp' and
`examples/loadable/ccpp-context.cpp'.

11.9 Adding a filter to Aspell standard distribution
====================================================

Any filter which one day should be added to Aspell has to be built
using the developer interface, described in *Note Programmer's
Interface::.  To add the filter the following steps have to be
performed:

  1. Decide whether the filter should be kept loadable if possible, or
     always be statically linked to Aspell.

  2.  Place the filter sources inside the entire directory of Aspell
     source tree.  Right now use `$top_srcdir/modules/filter'.

  3. Modify the `Makefile.am' file on the topmost directory of the
     Aspell distribution.  Follow the instructions given by the
     `#Filter Modules' section.

  4. Run `autoconf', `automake', ...

  5. Reconfigure sources.

  6.  Clear away any remains of a previous build and rebuild sources.

  7.  Reinstall Aspell.

  8.  Test if filter has been added properly otherwise return to steps
     2-7

  9. Reconfigure sources with `enable-static' flag and repeat steps 2-7
     until your filter builds and runs properly in case of static
     linkage.

 10. Add your source files to cvs, and commit all your changes.  Or in
     case you are not allowed to commit to cvs submit a patch (see
     *Note How to Submit a Patch::) containing your changes.

12 Filter Modes
***************

Filter modes are the preferred way to specify combinations of filters
which are used regularly and thus abbreviate Aspell's command line
arguments.

   A new filter mode is specified by a file named like the filter new
mode and prefixed by `.amf' (Aspell Mode File). If such a file is
accessible by the path set via filter-path option Aspell will try to
load the contained mode specification.

12.1 Aspell Mode File
=====================

The first key in the made file has be the `mode' key.  It is checked
against the mode name part of the .amf file.  If the `mode' key is
missing mode file will be rejected.

   The same holds for the `aspell' key which specifies the version(s)
of Aspell which is(are) required by the filter.

   If these two keys are followed by at least one `magic' key Aspell
will be able to select the entire mode from extension and if required
from contents of the file to spell implicitly.

   The last key of the required keys is the `des[c[ription]]' key. It
gives a short description of the filter mode which will displayed when
type `aspell help'.

   The rest of the file consists of the keys `filter' and `option' to
load filters are set various options.

12.1.1 Version Line
-------------------

Each version line must start with `aspell' and be followed by a
version, optionally prefixed by a relational operator. The relation
operator can be one of `<', `<=', `=', `>=' or '>' for allowing Aspell
version with version number being lower, lower or equal, equal to,
greater or equal or greater than required version number, respectfully.
If the relation operator is omitted `=' is assumed.

12.1.2 Magic Line
-----------------

The magic line contains a description which requirements files have to
fulfill in order to implicitly activate the entire mode at least one
such line is required.  Each magic line has the following format:
     MAGIC /<magic key>/<fileextention>[/<fileextention>]

   The magic key consist of three `:' separated fields.  The first two
are byte counts the last is a regular expression.  The first byte count
indicates the first byte the regular expression will be applied to the
second byte count indicates the number of bytes to test against the
regular expression.

   If mode selection should only occurred on basis of the listed file
extensions the magic key should consist of the "<noregex>" special
string.

   At least one <fileextention> is required per MAGIC line.
<fileextention> may not be empty and should not contain a leading `.'
as this is assumed implicitly.

   Multiple MAGIC lines are allowed. Modes may be extended limited by
additional <label>.amf files located in -filter-path Thus file
extensions may be prefixed by `+' or `-' to indicate that the entire
extension has to be added ore removed from this <magic key> if neither
is specified than a `+' is assumed implicitly.

12.1.3 Description Line
-----------------------

The required description line will be printed when typing `aspell
help'.  Keep it as short as possible.  Possible abbreviations are `des'
and `desc'.

12.1.4 Filter and Option Lines
------------------------------

The `filter' and `option' keys load filters and set filter options.

   The value of the `filter' key is equal to the value of Aspell's
`[add|rem]-filter' option.

   Each `option' line has the following format:

       OPTION <option> [<value>]

   The format of the <option> and <value> is the same format as found
in the Aspell configuration file.

13 Data Structures
******************

Whenever possible you should try to use one of the data structures
available.  If the data structures do not provide enough functionality
for your needs you should consider enhancing them rather than writing
something from scratch.

13.1 Vector
===========

The `vector' class is defined in `vector.hpp' and works the same way as
the standard STL `vector' does except that it doesn't have as many
constructors.

13.2 BasicList
==============

`BasicList' is a simple list structure which can either be implemented
as a singly or doubly linked list.  It is defined in `basic_list.hpp'.

13.3 StringMap
==============

`StringMap' is a associative array for strings.  You should try to use
this when ever possible to avoid code bloat.  It is defined in
`string_map.hpp'.

13.4 Hash Tables
================

Several hash tables are provided when `StringMap' is not appropriate.
These hash tables provide a `hash_set', `hash_multiset', `hash_map' and
`hash_multimap' which are very similar to SGI's STL implementation with
a few exceptions.  It is defined in `hash.hpp'.

13.5 BlockSList
===============

`BlockSList' provided a pool of nodes which can be used for singly
linked lists.  It is defined in `block_slist.hpp'.


File: aspell-dev.info,  Node: Mk-Src Script,  Next: How It All Works,  Prev: Data Structures,  Up: Top

14 Mk-Src Script
****************

A good deal of interface code is automatically generated by the
`mk-src.pl' Perl script.  I am doing it this way to avoid having to
write a lot of relative code for the C++ interface.  This should also
make adding interface for other languages a lot less tedious and will
allow the interface to automatically take advantage of new Aspell
functionality as it is made available.  The `mk-src.pl' script uses
`mk-src.in' as its input.

14.1 mk-src.in
==============

NOTE: This section may not always be up to date since it is manually
converted from the pod source.

   The format of `mk-src.in' is as follows:


    The following characters are literals: { } / '\ ' \n = >

    <items>
    <items> := (<item>\n)+
    <items> := <category>:\ <name> {\n<details>\n} | <<tab>><details>
    <details> := <options>\n /\n <items>
    <options> := (<option>\n)*
    <option> := <key> [=> <value>]

    <<tab>> means everything should be indented by one tab

   See MkSrc::Info for a description of the categories and options

14.2 MkSrc::Info
================

`%info'

   The info array contains information on how to process the info in
`mk-src.pl'. It has the following layout


    <catagory> => options => []
                  groups => [] # if undef than anything is accepted
                  creates_type => "" # the object will create a new type
                                     # as specified
                  proc => <impl type> => sub {}
     where <impl type> is one of:

    cc: for "aspell.h" header file
    cxx: for C++ interface implemented on top of cc interface
    native: for creation of header files used internally by aspell
    impl: for defination of functions declared in cc interface.
          the definations use the native hedaer files
    native_impl: for implementations of stuff declared in the native
                  header files
     each proc sub should take the following argv

    $data: a subtree of $master_data
    $accum:
     <options> is one of:

    desc: description of the object
    prefix:
    posib err: the method may return an error condition
    c func:
    const: the method is a const member
    c only: only include in the external interface
    c impl headers: extra headers that need to be included in the C impl
    c impl: use this as the c impl instead of the default
    cxx impl: use this as the cxx impl instead of the default
    returns alt type: the constructor returns some type other than
      the object from which it is a member of
    no native: do not attemt to create a native implementation
    treat as object: treat as a object rather than a pointer
     The `%info' structure is initialized as follows:

    our %info =
    (
     root => {
       options => [],
       groups => ['methods', 'group']},
     methods => {
       # methods is a collection of methods which will be inserted into
       # a class after some simple substation rules.  A $ will be
       # replaced with name of the class.
       options => ['strip', 'prefix', 'c impl headers'],
       groups => undef},
     group => {
       # a group is a colection of objects which should be grouped together
       # this generally means they will be in the same source file
       options => ['no native'],
       groups => ['enum', 'struct', 'union', 'func', 'class', 'errors']},
     enum => {
       # basic C enum
       options => ['desc', 'prefix'],
       creates_type => 'enum'},
     struct => {
       # basic c struct
       options => ['desc', 'treat as object'],
       groups => undef,
       creates_type => 'struct',},
     union => {
       # basic C union
       options => ['desc', 'treat as object'],
       groups => undef,
       creates_type => 'union'},
     class => {
       # C++ class
       options => ['c impl headers'],
       groups => undef,
       creates_type => 'class'},
     errors => {}, # possible errors
     method => {
       # A class method
       options => ['desc', 'posib err', 'c func', 'const',
                   'c only', 'c impl', 'cxx impl'],
       groups => undef},
     constructor => {
       # A class constructor
       options => ['returns alt type', 'c impl', 'desc'],
       groups => 'types'},
     destructor => {
       # A class destructor
       options => [],
       groups => undef},
     );
     In addition to the categories listed above a "methods" category by
be     specified in under the class category. A "methods" category is
created     for each methods group under the name "<methods name>
methods". When     groups is undefined a type name may be specified in
place of a category.

   `%types'

   types contains a master list of all types. This includes basic types
and     ones created in `mk-src.in'. The basic types include:

    'void', 'bool', 'pointer', 'double',
    'string', 'encoded string', 'string obj',
    'char', 'unsigned char',
    'short', 'unsigned short',
    'int', 'unsigned int',
    'long', 'unsigned long'
   %methods

   `%methods' is used for holding the "methods" information

14.3 MkSrc::Util

This module contains various useful utility functions:
`false'
     Returns 0.

`true'
     Returns 1.

`cmap EXPR LIST'
     Apply EXPR to each item in LIST and than concatenate the result
     into         a string

                data => <tree>
    where each tree represents an entry in mk-src.in.
    The following two options are always provided:
      name: the name of the entry
      type: the catagory or type name
    Additional options are the same as specified in %info

15 How It All Works
*******************

The details of how Aspell really works is a mystery to most users who
want to participate in developing and improving Aspell, so it is best
to fully explain Aspell's core algorithms and data structures to you.

   In explaining these, it is hoped to bring prospective developers up
to speed more quickly and also help you understand the amount of thought
put into this.  In time, you may be able to improve Aspell even more.

   There are many details to explain here, so these will need explaining
in small segments.

File: aspell-dev.info,  Node: Part 1 - Compiled Dictionary Format,  Next: Part 2 - Quickly Finding Similar Soundslike,  Prev: How It All Works,  Up: How It All Works

15.1 Part 1 - The Compiled Dictionary Format
============================================

In this part you will see how the data is laid out in the compiled
dictionary for Aspell 0.60.  See source file `readonly_ws.cpp'.

   Aspell's main compiled wordlist dictionary file is made as follows:

   * header

   * jump table for editdist 1

   * jump table for editdist 2

   * data block

   * hash table

   There is nothing particularly interesting about the header.  Just a
bunch of meta information.

   The jump tables are described in the next section ...

   Words in the data block are grouped based on the soundslike.  Each
group is as follows:

     <8 bit: offset to next item><8 bit: soundslike size><soundslike>
     <null><words>

Each word group is as follows:

     <8 bit: flags><8 bit: offset to next word><8 bit: word size><word><null>
     [<affix info><null>]

   The offset for the final word in each group points to the next word
in the following group.  The offset for the final word and soundslike
group in the dictionary is 0.

   There is some provisions for additional info to be stored with the
word but for simplicity, it's left out here.  If soundslike data is not
used then the soundslike block it not used.

   This format makes it easy to iterate over the data without using the
hash table.

   Each soundslike group can be a maximum of about 256 bytes.  If this
limit is reached then the soundslike group is split. Using 2 bytes for
the soundslike offset would of solved this problem however 256 bytes is
normally sufficient, thus I would of wasted some space by using an
extra byte.  More importantly, Using 2 bytes means I would of had to
worry about alignment issues.

   The soundslike groups are sorted in more or less alphabetic order.

   The hash table is a simple open address hash table.  The key is the
dictionary word in all lowercase form with all accents removed (what is
known as the "clean" form of the word).  The value stored in the table
is a 32-bit offset to the beginning of the word.  A 32-bit integer
offset is used rather than a pointer so that the compiled dictionary
can be mmaped to make loading the dictionary very fast and so that the
memory can be shared between processed, and on 64 bit platforms using
pointers would have doubled the size of the hash table.

   Additional information for each word can be derived from each offset:

     word size: offset - 1
     offset to next word: offset - 2
     flags: offset - 3

   I use helper functions for getting this information.  Doing it this
way rather than having a data structure is slightly evil, but
admittedly, I have my reasons.

   In the next section, you will see how Aspell uses the jump tables to
search the list for _soundslike_ with _edit-distance_ of 1 or 2.


File: aspell-dev.info,  Node: Part 2 - Quickly Finding Similar Soundslike,  Next: Part 3,  Prev: Part 1 - Compiled Dictionary Format,  Up: How It All Works

15.2 Part 2 - Quickly Finding Similar Soundslike
================================================

In order for Aspell to find suggestions for a misspelled word Aspell 1)
creates a list of candidate words, 2) scores them, and 3) returns the
most likely candidates.  One of the ways Aspell finds candidate words
is to look for all words with a soundslike which is of a small edit
distance from the soundslike of the original word.  The edit distance
is the total number of deletions, insertions, exchanges, or adjacent
swaps needed to make one string equivalent to the other. The exact
distance chosen is either 1 or 2 depending on a number of factors.  In
this part I will focus on how Aspell find all such soundslike
efficiently and how the jump tables play a key role.

   This section will focus on how Aspell finds all such soundslike
efficiently and how the jump tables play a key role.

   The naive way to scan the list for all possible soundslike is to
compute the edit-distance of every soundslike in the dictionary and
then keep the ones within the threshold.  This is exactly what Aspell
did prior to 0.60. before a faster method was created.  When a fast
enough edit distance function is used this method turns out not to be
unbearably slow, at least for English, but for other languages, with
large word lists and no soundslike, this can be slow due to the number
of items that need to be scanned.

   Aspell uses a special edit distance function which gives up if the
distance is larger than the threshold, thus making it very fast.  The
basic algorithm is as follows:

     limit_edit_distance(A,B,limit) = ed(A,B,0)
       where ed(A,B,d) = d                              if A & B is empty.
                       = infinity                       if d > limit
                       = ed(A[2..],B[2..], d)           if A[1] == B[1]
                       = min ( ed(A[2..],B[2..], d+1),
                               ed(A,     B[2..], d+1),
                               ed(A[2..],B,      d+1) ) otherwise

   However the algorithm used also allows for swaps and is not
recursive.  Specialized versions are provided for an edit distance of
one and two.  The running time is asymptotically bounded above by
`(3^l)*n' where `l' is the limit and `n' is the maximum of
`strlen(A),strlen(B)'.  Based on informal tests, the `n' does not
really matter and the running time is more like `(3^l)'.

   For complete details on this algorithm see the files `leditdist.hpp'
and `leditdist.cpp' in the source distribution under
`modules/speller/default'.

   So, by exploiting the properties of `limit_edit_distance' it is
possible to avoid having to look at many of the soundslikes in the
dictionary.  `Limit_edit_distance' is efficient because in many cases,
it does not have to look at the entire word before it can determine
that it isn't within the given threshold, and then by having it return
the last position looked at, _p_, it is possible to avoid having to
look at similar soundslike which are not within the threshold.  That
is, if two soundslike are the same up to the position `p', then neither
of them are within the given threshold.

   Aspell 0.60 exploits this property by using jump tables.  Each entry
in the jump table contains two fields: the first `N' letters of a
soundslike, and an offset.  The entries are sorted in lexicographic
order based on the raw byte value.  Aspell maintains two jump tables.

   The first table contains the first 2 letters of a soundslike and the
offset points into the second jump table.

   The second table contains the first 3 letters of a soundslike where
the offset points to the location of the soundslike in the data block.
The soundslike in the datablock are sorted so that a linear scan can be
used to find all soundslike with the same prefix.  If the
`limit_edit_distance' stops before reaching the end of a _"soundslike"_
in one of the jump tables then it is possible to skip all the
soundslike in the data block with the same prefix.

   Thus, the scan for all _soundslike_ within a given edit distance
goes something like this:

  1. Compare the entry in the first jump table using
     `limit_edit_distance'.  If the `limit_edit_distance' scanned
     passed the end of the word, then go to the first entry in the
     second jump table with the same prefix, otherwise go to the next
     entry in the first jump table and repeat.

  2. Compare the entry in the second jump table.  If the
     `limit_edit_distance'  passed the end of the word, then go to the
     first _soundslike_ in the data block with this prefix, otherwise
     if the first two letters of the next entry are the same as the
     current one go to it and repeat.  If the first two letters are not
     the same then go to the next entry in the first jump table and
     repeat step 1.

  3. Compare the _soundslike_ in the data block.  If the edit distance
     is within the target distance, then add the word to the candidate
     list, otherwise don't.  Let `N' be the position where
     `limit_edit_distance' stopped, (starting at 0).  If `N' is less
     than 6, then skip over any soundslike that have the same first `N
     + 1' letters.  If after skipping over any similar _soundslike_ the
     next _soundslike_ does not have the same first three letters, then
     go to the next entry in the second jump table and repeat step 2,
     otherwise repeat this step with the next _soundslike_.


   The part of skipping over _soundslike_ with the first `N + 1'
letters in step 3 were added in Aspell 0.60.3.  The function
responsible for most of this is found in function
`ReadOnlyDict::SoundslikeElements::next' which is found in file
`readonly_ws.cpp'.

   The next part will describe how Aspell deals with _soundslike_
lookup when affix compression is involved.

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to
     assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,
     with or without modifying it, either commercially or
     noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License preserves for the
     author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not
     being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a notice
     grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration,
     to use that work under the conditions stated herein.  The
     "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any member
     of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".  You
     accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a
     way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
     of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
     publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
     subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could
     fall directly within that overall subject.  (Thus, if the Document
     is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not
     explain any mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of
     historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or
     of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position
     regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the Document
     does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may
     be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats include
     PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or
     XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF
     produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses
     following text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ
     stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as
     "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)
     To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when you modify the
     Document means that it remains a section "Entitled XYZ" according
     to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in
     this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
     implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and
     has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and
     the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
     which the general network-using public has access to download
     using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent
     copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed
          in the History section of the Document).  You may use the
          same title as a previous version if the original publisher of
          that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in
          the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History" in
          the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors,
          and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page,
          then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in
          the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for a
          work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
          Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the
          section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor
          acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
          or the equivalent are not considered part of the section
          titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text
     has been approved by an organization as the authoritative
     definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual
     works permit.  When the Document is included in an aggregate, this
     License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which
     are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half
     of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed
     on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the
     electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic
     form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket
     the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License, and all the license notices in the
     Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also
     include the original English version of this License and the
     original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original version of
     this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will
     prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the
     actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     `http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/'.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.

A.1.1 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
----------------------------------------------------------

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
