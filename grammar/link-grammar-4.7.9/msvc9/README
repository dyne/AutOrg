This directory contains project files for building Link Grammar with the
Miscrosoft Visual C++ 2008 IDE. They were created and tested with the 
Express Edition of that product. 


- to compile LinkGrammar, open the solution file LinkGrammar.sln and build 
the LinkGrammar project. You might get compile errors about a missing 
link-features.h include file. If so, please go ahead and rename the file
'link-grammar/link-features.h.in' to link-features.h. This is normally done
by a Unix configure script, but needs to be manually done when compiling with
Visual C++.
- to compile the Java bindings, you need to add Java include directories to
the LinkGrammarJava project first. This is in project properties->C/C++->General->
Additional Include Directories. You need both JAVA_HOME/include and JAVA_HOME/include/win32
where JAVA_HOME is your JDK's installation directory.
- the projects are configured to create a debug version by default, it's probably
a good idea to switch the a "Release" configuration. You can do this at
Build Menu->Configuration Manager.

NOTE: The created DLLs need the MSVC9 runtime environment to run. This is normally
already installed in your machine with the installation of the IDE. But to be
able to run Link Grammar on other computer you need to install the Visual C++ 2008 
runtime redistributable from:

this redistributable does not contain debug version of the MSVC runtime, so only
"Release" Link Grammar will work with it.
