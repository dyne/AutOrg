This directory contains code for prototype Viterbi decoder for Link
Grammar. Actually, its not even a prototype, yet, since its hardly
begun, and it doesn't work.  The data structures vaguely resemble
those of the OpenCog AtomSpace; the reason for this is that they provide
a natural setting for storing Vitebrbi state information; that is, for
holding the various partly-finished parses, and effecting state
transformations on them.
