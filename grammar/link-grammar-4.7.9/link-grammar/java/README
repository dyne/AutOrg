                 Java Bindings for Link Grammar
                 ------------------------------

These files implement Java language bindings for Link Grammar. They do
not extend the parsing algorithms already present in Link-Grammar in
any way. They do, however, allow certain types of remote/server
operation, and, in particular, are needed for use by the RelEx
dependency parser.
