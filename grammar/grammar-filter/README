This directory contains the grammar checker mode for Emacs.

Link Grammar (http://www.link.cs.cmu.edu/link/) is used as the back-end
grammar checker.  A small C/C++ program called grammar is written based
on the Link Grammar API to perform grammar checking for a given
sentence, and grammar mode is simply the interface between Emacs and
this grammar program.

Stealing the idea of Flyspell, we want to make grammar.el do on-the-fly
grammar checking.  When detecting that the Emacs user has finished
typing a sentence, we will grab the sentence and send it to the grammar
program.  The grammar program will then tell us if the sentence contains
any grammar error(s).  The problematic word(s) that contributed to the
grammar error(s) will be highlighted...

This mode is still in its early development stage.  Any ideas on how to
make it more useful are welcome!

Thanks,
