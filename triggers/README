This directory contains files touched by git-hooks that confirm when a
cronjob should  be run, rebuilding the  web files. This  way we obtain
uid/gid  separation of  processes (between  git-hooks and  cron) while
being able to update our files  much more often (cpu will be used only
when needed.

Scripts called from dyne-web/etc/cron.d will  check here if a hook has
been triggered and, if yes, run their tasks.
