AutOrg is designed and maintained by Denis Roio <Jaromil@dyne.org>

It was initially conceived together with Hellekin O. Wolf,
with documentation and ideas contributed by Yaakov Nemoy.

Emacs was written by Richard M. Stallman and several other contributors.

Org-mode is a brilliant Emacs extension written by Carsten Dominik.

AutOrg also includes various other Emacs extensions not yet documented here,
but this list should be expanded soon.
